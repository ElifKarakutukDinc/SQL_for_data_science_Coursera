Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	
query: select count(*)
	   from table_name;

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

query: select count(distinct cloumn)
	   from table_name;

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

I have two answers that I did different ways. 
--A-1: With Correlation Function

select avg( (review_count - avg_rc) * (fans - avg_f) )*avg( (review_count - avg_rc) * (fans - avg_f) )/(var_rc*var_f) as R
from user, (select 
      avg_rc,
      avg_f,
      avg((review_count - avg_rc)*(review_count - avg_rc)) as var_rc, 
      avg((fans - avg_f)*(fans - avg_f)) as var_f 
      from user, (select 
          avg(review_count) as avg_rc, 
          avg(fans) as avg_f 
          from user)
  );

+----------------+
|              R |
+----------------+
| 0.437136492915 |
+----------------+

--Correlation: As r approaches -1 or 1, the strength of the relationship increases. Fans and review_count between has a positive relation but not strong. They not affect each others directly.

--A-2:Basic Way
--You can see in the table below, fans values which are at cross high review_count rows change. Some rows are high but some rows are very less. This case shows that they don't affect each others directly

select review_count, fans
from user
order by review_count desc;

11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
--We have two question. First phase want power of corrlation between fans and useful or funny. Firstly, I looked correlation. 
First phase : 

select (avg( (fans - avg_f) * (useful - avg_u) )*avg( (fans - avg_f) * (useful - avg_u) ))/(var_f*var_u) as R
from user, (select 
      avg_f,
      avg_u,
      avg((fans - avg_f)*(fans - avg_f)) as var_f, 
      avg((useful - avg_u)*(useful - avg_u)) as var_u 
      from user, (select 
          avg(fans) as avg_f, 
          avg(useful) as avg_u
          from user)
  )order by fans desc;

          avg(fans) as avg_f, 
          avg(funny) as avg_fu
          from user)
  )
order by fans desc;

	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

for useful: 
+----------------+
|              R |
+----------------+
| 0.157528494749 |
+----------------+

For funny:
+---------------+
|             R |
+---------------+
| 0.12488127215 |
+---------------+

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
You can see R values 0.15 and 0.12. It means that each other don't have strong relationship. 	

Second phase: Second question wants, we find 10 users who have highest number of fans and we look just they are listed or not listed with useful and funny.
When I looked at the table values that useful and funny don't have null values but they have zero values. So I saw that 10 users are marked useful and funny. 
Anyone doesn't have zero value. 

Select id, fans, useful, funny

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
2-3 stars businesses have average 13 hours distribution. 4-5 stars businesses have less than 13 hours distribution. Yes two groups have a different distribution of hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes two groups have a different number of reviews. 4-5 stars group has a lot of more reviews.        
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
2-3 stars businesses have 0 non-empty neighbourhood information but 4-5 stars businesses have 2 non-empty neighbourhood information which is an information that high start rating businesses fill their neighbourhood information. So there is a difference between the groups.

SQL code used for analysis:

i.
select  hours,
       case WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
	   WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: Number of stars given of closed business is less than open business.           
         
ii. Difference 2:Number of review done of closed business is less than open business.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
A business who will open want to decide which at city. They want to learn which city is popular for a restaurant, Toronto or Las Vegas.           
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
 I need columns which are city, category, average stars, average review_count and number of restaurants. In order to understand which columns are important for opening new busineses in cities.
    And you can see at below;
    -Toronto has 10 restaurants but their average stars and average review_count is too low. 
    -Number of Las Vegas' restaurants is less than Toronto's restaurant. 
    -However, Restaurants have a lot of review and stars in Las Vegas. 
    -This case shows, restaurants at Las Vegas are more popular than Toronto's.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+-----------+-------------+------------+-------------------+-----------+
| city      | category    | avg(stars) | avg(review_count) | count(id) |
+-----------+-------------+------------+-------------------+-----------+
| Toronto   | Restaurants |        3.4 |              29.9 |        10 |
| Las Vegas | Restaurants |      3.875 |             265.5 |         4 |
+-----------+-------------+------------+-------------------+-----------+             
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

select  city, category, avg(stars), avg(review_count), count(id)
from business as b 
left join category as c on (c.business_id= b.id)
where category='Restaurants' and city in ('Toronto','Las Vegas')
group by city
order by count(id) desc;
